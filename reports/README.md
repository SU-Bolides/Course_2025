# Reports

Every problem encountered that you managed to solve should be logged and reported here. Use descriptive titles, concise wording, but do not leave out crucial information.

## This seems like a hassle, why do this? 

Because you WILL encounter problems again, and you WILL have forgotten how you solved them in the first place. So now, if you're rigorous enough to stick to the constant reporting, you will be able to just find the corresponding log file and follow your own instructions. 

And who knows, maybe someone else in the future will learn from your mistakes too :)
