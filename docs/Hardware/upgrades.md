# Possible upgrades   

## Yeah Racing Drift Kit (TATT-014)

Ordered for the 2025 PFE, but requires other parts to be used. Here is the list of parts needed to install it:

-TATT-009
-TATT-011
-TATT-013

Would certainly help, but could cause issues with stability. I think it needs to be explored. 

## Raspberry Pi 5

Already installed on the SLAM car, it's a hassle to setup due to the to go through a docker container to install ros-noetic. Also wasn't able to make it generate a PWM signal, as reported online, so it's not trivial.
If you were to use ROS2, though, you could make it work pretty well. It runs hotter than the RPi 4 though, so it requires a fan. 

## Pimoroni Fan SHIM 

Already installed on the SLAM car via a 3D printed mount. Sleek, cheap, quiet, probably slightly more effective than placebo. Should be combined with a small heatsink to increase efficiency.
