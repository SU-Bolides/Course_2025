# Sorbonne University Bolides Manual

This is the website where you will find all the answers and explanations related to the Sorbonne University TT02 1/10th race cars made for the CoVAPSy Races. 

This might not be fully done yet, but I am actively working on completing this before I finish my masters degree. If there's anything you need that isn't covered here, ask me directly by sending me an email me@nicolashammje.com.

Have fun working on this. 

## Where to start 

If you don't know anything about the car, start by reading through the Introduction. If you want to get the car running as soon as possible, read the [Quick Start Guide](https://sorbonneuniversitybolidecontributors.github.io/Course_2025/quickstart.html). 

The rest is covered in the other pages. You can also check out the "ressources" folder in the main repo to check out the different documents related to the project.
